# Project docs

Welcome — this folder contains concise, audience-focused docs for developers and deployers.

Contents

- `running.md` — Quick Start: run, test, build, and deploy (Windows PowerShell examples).
- `deploy-vercel.md` — Vercel-specific deployment guide and troubleshooting steps.
- `architecture.md` — High-level architecture notes and file structure (coming soon).

If you're new here, open `running.md` first for quick, copy-paste commands to get the app running locally.
